/*
 * Phoenix-RTOS
 *
 * Raspberry Pi 4 (BCM2711) V3D 4.2 asynchronous render server - scan-out
 * placement below 1 GiB (V3DA_BO_LOWMEM, protocol 5)
 *
 * The firmware display plane fetches nothing at or above 1 GiB, and the kernel's
 * page allocator (vm/page.c, a buddy allocator) takes no address constraint: a
 * MAP_CONTIGUOUS block lands wherever the first free block of its order is. So a
 * BO that may be scanned out takes, in this order:
 *   1. a pooled block of its size and memory type that lies below the limit;
 *   2. fresh blocks, up to V3DA_LOWMEM_TRIES of them, until one lies below the
 *      limit (rpi4-kms reserves its scan-out pool the same way, kms_pool_init).
 *      The rejects are held while trying, so that each try is a different block,
 *      and handed back to the kernel afterwards (safe since the E1 section 6
 *      object-tree fix, kernel d0fb0ca9 / build 8). If none lands low, the last
 *      one is kept: the BO is created anyway, and rpi4-kms refuses it at ADDFB2.
 * within a budget of low memory held by such BOs (the VideoCore, rpi4-kms's pool
 * and every other DMA user need the low GiB too). An ordinary BO takes a pooled
 * block ABOVE the limit when the pool has both, so pooled low blocks are kept for
 * the next scan-out BO.
 *
 * Pure functions over a pool array and an allocator callback (no Phoenix headers,
 * no server state), so tools/gpu-lane/v3d-async/hosttest/run.sh checks exactly the
 * policy the server applies.
