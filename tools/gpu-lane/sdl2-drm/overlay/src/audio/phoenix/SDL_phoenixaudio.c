#ifdef SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER_PHOENIX

/*
 * Phoenix-RTOS audio driver (Raspberry Pi 4 / BCM2711).
 *
 * A PULL-model backend over the rpi4-audio device node /dev/audio0. SDL's audio
 * thread calls the app's callback to fill the mixing buffer, then invokes
 * PlayDevice, which write()s that buffer straight to /dev/audio0. The rpi4-audio
 * driver is a PIO device with a fixed native format (44100 Hz, stereo, signed
 * 16-bit little-endian); its blocking write() drains the PWM FIFO at the real
 * playback rate, so the write itself provides natural backpressure and paces the
 * audio thread. WaitDevice is therefore a no-op.
 *
 * This is a pull-model backend: same open()/format/write() on /dev/audio0 as a
 * push feeder would use, but with the opposite control flow (rather than a feeder
 * thread draining a mixer ring, SDL's own audio thread drives us).
 *
 * The device format is fixed, so OpenDevice forces _this->spec to the native
 * format and lets SDL build a conversion stream from the app's requested spec.
