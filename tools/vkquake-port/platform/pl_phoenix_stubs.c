 * pl_phoenix_stubs.c — small Phoenix shims for symbols vkQuake's excluded platform TUs
 * (net_bsd.c, pl_linux.c) used to provide. First-light: Loopback-only networking (so
 * single-player "map"/"newgame" via Loop_Connect works; no UDP/LAN — see the quakespasm
 * port's rationale below), and the Mesa clock helper libphoenix lacks.
 *
 * Adapted from quakespasm-port/platform/pl_phoenix_stubs.c. vkQuake's net_driver_t has a
 * different field set than quakespasm's (it adds QueryAddresses + QGetAnyMessage and
 * renames Get/SendMessage to QGet/QSendMessage), so we use DESIGNATED initializers keyed
 * to net_defs.h's field names — robust to the layout change.

 * two runtime objects this build never reaches at runtime:
 *
 *   vk_texcompress_astc.c  -> the software ASTC-decode meta path. V3D 4.2 decodes ASTC in
 *                             hardware, so V3DV never registers/calls the emulated decoder;
 *                             its LUT helpers (_mesa_{init_astc_decoder_luts,
 *                             get_astc_decoder_partition_table}) live in src/util and are
 *                             not in the linked archives.
 *   vk_rmv_exporter.c      -> the Radeon Memory Visualizer trace dump (vk_dump_rmv_capture),
 *                             a debug-tooling path; its util_get_process_name dep is unused.
 *
 * Nothing references these objects' exported symbols (verified via nm + the prior link
 * reaching staging-buffer init without pulling them), so they are inert. We satisfy their
 * three dangling deps with TRAP stubs that Sys_Error (already linked) rather than spin: an
 * unexpected reach prints to UART instead of silently hanging (the orchestrator reads UART). */
