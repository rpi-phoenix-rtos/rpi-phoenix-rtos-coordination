/*
 * Phoenix-RTOS kdrive fbdev DDX — a minimal software X server backend that
 * paints onto the Raspberry Pi 4 HDMI framebuffer exposed at /dev/fb0.
 *
 * Why this file exists: xorg-server >= 1.17 dropped the kdrive "Xfbdev" backend
 * (hw/kdrive/fbdev). This is a fresh, small reimplementation on the surviving
 * kdrive core (hw/kdrive/src), written against the Phoenix /dev/fb0 ABI rather
 * than the Linux fbdev ABI. It is modelled structurally on the Xephyr backend
 * (hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyr*.c) — same KdCardFuncs lifecycle — but the "host" is
 * the bare framebuffer device, not another X server.
 *
 * Framebuffer model (Phoenix-specific, see sources/.../video/rpi4-fb):
 *   - Geometry comes from the RPI4FB_GETMODE devctl (width/height/bpp/pitch).
 *   - /dev/fb0 supports read()/write() at a file offset but NOT a live
 *     mmap(fd, 0) backing (issue #149). So we always use a SHADOW framebuffer
 *     (kdrive's KdShadowFbAlloc): X renders into ordinary RAM, and on each
 *     damage update we lseek()+write() the dirty scanlines out to /dev/fb0.
 *
 * Input is wired to the Phoenix USB HID devices /dev/kbd0 (8-byte boot-keyboard
 * reports) and /dev/mouse0 (4-byte boot-mouse packets). See the input-driver
 * section below for the HID-usage -> evdev-keycode mapping and the
 * InputThreadRegisterDev() fd-polling model.

 * Input drivers — Phoenix USB HID keyboard (/dev/kbd0) + mouse (/dev/mouse0).
 *
 * Event sourcing. We register each device fd in the driver's Enable() via
 * InputThreadRegisterDev(fd, cb, arg) and unregister in Disable() via
 * InputThreadUnregisterDev(fd). That call routes to one of two poll paths and
 * both are safe for us:
 *   - input thread active (inputThreadInfo != NULL): the dedicated input thread
 *     (os/inputthread.c) polls the fd and calls our callback wrapped in
 *     input_lock()/input_unlock() (InputReady()).
 *   - otherwise it falls back to SetNotifyFd() (os.h), i.e. the fd is polled in
 *     the server's main dispatch loop and the callback runs on the main thread —
 *     the same path ephyr uses.
 * Either way a single thread both enqueues (our callback) and dequeues (dix), so
 * the callback needs no extra locking, and reading the device never blocks the
 * dispatch loop (the fds are O_NONBLOCK and the drain is bounded).
 *
 * KEYBOARD. usbkbd is put into RAW mode (write a single 0x01 byte to /dev/kbd0;
 * see usbkbd.c) so it delivers raw 8-byte HID boot-keyboard reports rather than
 * a cooked ASCII stream. Raw reports carry the full key-state array on every
 * change, so by diffing each report against the previous one we derive real
 * key-DOWN and key-UP events (X needs both; cooked ASCII cannot express key-up).
 *   HID report: [0]=modifier bitmask, [1]=reserved, [2..7]=up to 6 pressed usages.
 *
 * HID-usage -> X keycode. The compiled-in keymap is us/pc105 under the evdev
 * rules, whose keycodes are POSITIONAL (not the alphabetical layout of HID
 * usages). We map HID usage -> Linux evdev keycode via the canonical kernel
 * table (drivers/hid/usbhid/usbkbd.c usb_kbd_keycode[256]) then add the X
 * keycode offset of 8 (X keycode = evdev keycode + 8). With minScanCode = 8
 * (= KD_MIN_KEYCODE), KdEnqueueKeyboardEvent's formula passes the value through
 * unchanged. Anchors: Esc usage 0x29 -> evdev 1 -> X 9; 'a' 0x04 -> 30 -> 38;
 * Space 0x2c -> 57 -> 65. We send keycodes ONLY: XKB derives keysyms/chars from
 * keycode + modifier state, so there is no char/shift handling here. Modifier
 * keys are just their own evdev keycodes, pressed/released by diffing byte[0].
 *
 * MOUSE. usbmouse delivers raw 4-byte HID boot-mouse packets on change:
 *   [0]=buttons (bit0 L, bit1 R, bit2 M), [1]=dx int8, [2]=dy int8, [3]=wheel.
 * We map HID buttons -> KD button mask: KD_BUTTON_1=L(0x01), KD_BUTTON_2=MIDDLE
 * (0x02), KD_BUTTON_3=RIGHT(0x04) — note HID's right/middle bit order is the
 * reverse of KD's, so we remap rather than pass through. One
 * KdEnqueuePointerEvent(pi, buttons | KD_MOUSE_DELTA, dx, dy, 0) per packet
 * delivers relative motion + the current button mask together.
 *
