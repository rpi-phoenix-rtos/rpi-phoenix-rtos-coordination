# vkQuake → Phoenix-RTOS Pi4 (aarch64-phoenix, V3DV) — build scaffold + gap inventory

> **STATUS (2026-06-28): CPU-TILE DISCRIMINATOR BUILT + LINKED (host-side, awaiting one boot).**
> Implemented the doc's "DO THIS FIRST" discriminator: a build-time CPU-tile path in
> `tools/v3d-driver-port/v3d_phoenix_winsys.c` `ioc_submit_tfu()`, gated by `#ifdef VKQ_CPU_TILE`
> (set via `VKQ_CPU_TILE=1` env in `build-v3d-phoenix.py`/`build-v3dv-phoenix.py`; default OFF, so
> GLQuake/normal path is byte-unchanged — verified: default-build archives contain 0 markers).
> For UIF dest + RASTER source images it CPU-tiles the staging buffer straight into the (uncached)
> dest image BO via the existing `uif_pixel_off()` tiler and **skips the HW TFU kick**; non-UIF
> mips / tiled (image→image) sources fall through to the real TFU. Strict gating: dst FORMAT field
> 6/7, src ICFG FORMAT 0 (RASTER), src row stride from `iis`, bounds-checked against the dst BO end,
> `__sync_synchronize()` + the read-side L2T/SLC coherency epilogue kept. **HARDENED past the probe:
> the tiler now derives the macroblock stride from the slice PADDED height** (transcribed
> `v3d_get_ub_pad` + `padded_height = align(h,8)+ub_pad*8`), not the bare copy height — a no-op for
> all power-of-two heights (ub_pad==0) but correct for NPOT, so the discriminator is unambiguous.
>
> **Rebuilt + verified (host-side only, NO Pi boot — coordinator owns the UART):**
> `tools/.gpu-libs/libv3d-phoenix.a` (408 objs) + `libv3dv-phoenix.a` (119 objs) + `libvkquake.a`
> (82 TUs) → `/tmp/vkquake-phoenix` (23 MB ELF), **LINK OK / 0 undefined**. Same libs also copied to
> the stale `/tmp/lib*.a` paths the doc once referenced. **Log marker to grep on the next boot:**
> `TFU CPU-TILE path` (prints `WxH xor=N phgt=N ub_pad=N ... HW TFU skipped`, rate-limited like the
> probe). Also `TFU CPU-TILE skip`/`FALLTHROUGH` for images that took the HW path.
> - **Boot shows CLEAN textures** → the HW TFU diverged from the `uif_pixel_off` padded-height
>   formula at points vcheck didn't sample (a HW-faithfulness gap on the upload side) AND we have a
>   shippable CPU-tile fallback. (The CPU tiler writes the SAME padded-height layout the TFU should,
>   so "clean" specifically means the HW TFU was unfaithful to that layout, not a generic blit bug.)
> - **Boot STILL striped** → the layout formula is faithful but the descriptor reads it wrong → the
>   bug is read-side (descriptor/slice-offset); the Mesa dive targets the v3dv-vs-gallium descriptor
>   diff (see below), NOT image-height.
> - **COORDINATOR CHECK (load-bearing): grep the per-texture marker TYPE, don't just look at HDMI.**
>   The discriminator's verdict is only valid for textures that printed `TFU CPU-TILE path`. Confirm
>   the visibly-striped textures print `path`, NOT `FALLTHROUGH`/`skip`. The XOR bounds check is
>   deliberately conservative (over-estimates by `0x10*mb_w*256`, e.g. +128 KB for a 256-wide XOR
>   image); if the dest BO is sized tight to its slice, an XOR texture could spuriously FALLTHROUGH to
>   the HW TFU (logged with `max_off`/`avail`) → that texture tested the HW path, not the CPU path =
>   no discriminator signal for it. If XOR textures fall through, tighten the bound to
>   `mb_w*((phgt+7)/8)*256` (drop the `+0x10` — UIF_XOR interleave stays within the padded slice) and
>   rebuild. The over-bound is memory-SAFE; only tighten if the boot shows it neutering the test.
>
> **Pre-staged Mesa analysis (host-side, while the Pi was owned) — ub_pad theory RETIRED.** Traced
> `v3dv_image.c v3d_setup_plane_slices` (slice `padded_height`, `ub_pad`) → the buffer→image TFU in
> `v3dv_meta_copy.c` (`ios=(slice->height<<16)|width` = BARE height; `dst_padded_height_or_stride =
> slice->padded_height` folded to ICFG OPAD) → the TMU descriptor in `v3dvx_image.c
> pack_texture_shader_state` (`tex.image_height = bare height`, `tex.level_0_ub_pad = slices[0].ub_pad`,
> `extended=true`). The original `uif_pixel_off` probe ignored ub_pad, which looked like a candidate —
> BUT checking the actual uploaded sizes from the prior striping boots (`grep -a "TFU copy"` in
> `artifacts/`/`docs/done/`: only 2x2/8x8/8x9 [non-UIF] + 64²/128²/256²), **every UIF texture there has
> ub_pad==0** (all power-of-two heights → `v3d_get_ub_pad`→0). So ub_pad CANNOT explain the observed
> striping, and `uif_pixel_off` is not even in the real render path (probe + CPU-tiler only). The
> honest scoped truth: vcheck's write-side proof only ever covered ub_pad==0 sizes — a real coverage
> limit, not the cause. NEXT Mesa dive (if still-striped): diff the **v3dv** descriptor/slice setup
> (`v3dvx_image.c pack_texture_shader_state` + `v3dv_image.c` slice offset/stride) against the
> **working gallium GLQuake** path (`v3d_resource.c` + gallium `v3dx` TEXTURE_SHADER_STATE) for POT
> UIF — GLQuake samples POT UIF cleanly through the same TMU, so whatever the v3dv descriptor does
> differently is the read-side bug.

> ---
> **STATUS (2026-06-27): TEXTURE-UPLOAD GAP CLOSED on the write side; striping localized to a
> single TFU→TMU CACHE-FENCE bug.** The TFU buffer→image copy is now implemented and executes
> in `v3d_phoenix_winsys.c` (present-hang gone; textures upload via TFU; extent + TMUWCF
> write-combiner fixes landed). Quake content reaches the GPU — but textures sample **striped**
> (horizontal banding). Two diagnostic probe boots pinned the cause precisely:
> - `TILING` probe → block-0 UIF correct (but block-0 is XOR/stride-invariant, too weak).
> - `TFU vcheck` vertical/inter-block probe → **`UIF-VERIFIED match=6/6`** on 64²/128²/256²
>   (incl. the `xor=1` variant): the TFU's FULL UIF output — vertical layout (y=8/16/32,
>   (8,8)/(16,16)) and the XOR page-interleave — is **correct in memory** (CPU-mapped read via
>   mesa `uif_pixel_off`). So **write-side is REFUTED**. And since GLQuake renders textured
>   through the IDENTICAL TMU/descriptor/MMU/L2T path with CPU-tiled UIF textures, the
>   **read-side descriptor is also proven correct**.
> - ∴ The bug is a **TFU-write → TMU-read coherency fence gap**: data is correct in memory but
>   samples striped ⇒ the L2T texture cache (and/or the TFU's TMUWCF write-combiner) is **not
>   flushed/invalidated between the TFU copy (`ioc_submit_tfu`) and the render CL that samples
>   the texture**. The TMU fetches stale/partial lines → banding.
>
> **UPDATE 2026-06-27 (later) — L2C per-job-invalidate fence tried + REFUTED on HW.** The first
> fence candidate (coord `ebc33fb`): the winsys did the general-L2 (L2C) invalidate only ONCE at
> init, whereas Linux `v3d_invalidate_caches` runs `L2CACTL=L2CCLR|L2CENA` before EVERY job; since
> the TMU fetches through L2C, a stale L2C line at a recycled GPU VA was a plausible cause. Added
> the per-job L2C invalidate to the TFU/bin/render prologues. **HW result (vkq-l2c-fence boot): the
> fence fires (marker confirmed) but textures STILL sample striped** (HDMI texture-upload test
> pattern shows persistent horizontal banding). So L2C is NOT the cause. **The `ebc33fb` per-job
> L2C invalidate is KEPT regardless** — it is a correctness/coherency hardening that matches the
> Linux reference (init-only L2C was a latent bug), just not the fix for striping.
>
> **CONFIRMED remaining cause (the real one): the slice-height/stride PARAMETER fed to vkQuake's
> TMU descriptor is wrong for this image — a v3dv image-creation/blit-layout bug.** Scope it
> carefully: GLQuake proves the TMU read PATH and the whole cache hierarchy (L2C/L2T/MMU) are
> sound, but it does NOT prove vkQuake's descriptor is correct — GLQuake builds its texture images
> through a SEPARATE (gallium v3d) image-creation path, so its correctness does not transfer to the
> v3dv descriptor params. With write-side proven correct (UIF-VERIFIED 6/6) and the cache-fence
> refuted, the remaining difference is that the **TFU blit and the TMU sampler are handed different
> tiled HEIGHT/STRIDE values for the same vkQuake image**. The `TFU vcheck` probe passes precisely
> because it verifies the TFU output against the TFU's OWN `ios`/height — it is blind to a TMU
> descriptor that reads with a different slice height. Both values are computed by the ported Mesa
> v3dv code (image creation `v3dv_image` slice layout + the meta-copy/TFU blit `ios` setup),
> OUTSIDE `tools/v3d-driver-port`'s winsys. NEXT INVESTIGATION (a focused Mesa-v3dv dive): locate
> where the TFU job sets the destination image height/stride (`t->ios`, `mb_h`, OPAD) vs where the
> TMU `TEXTURE_SHADER_STATE` descriptor takes the sampled slice height/`uif_height`, and reconcile
> them (ref `external/mesa` `src/broadcom/vulkan/v3dv_image.c` + `v3dx_pack` TEXTURE_SHADER_STATE +
> `v3d_tiling.c` / `v3d_resource` slice setup). This is the LAST blocker and it lives in the v3dv
> ICD, not the winsys.
>
> **DO THIS FIRST — the CPU-tile discriminator (one unambiguous boot, not a code-reading hunt).**
> Before diving into the v3dv image-creation code, settle which side is wrong with a single boot:
> CPU-tile the vkQuake texture into the mapped image BO instead of TFU-tiling it — reuse the
> `uif_pixel_off()` tiler already living in the `TFU vcheck` probe to write the texels directly into
> the mapped image BO, and SKIP the `vkCmdCopyBufferToImage`/TFU upload for that image. Then boot:
> - **Clean textures** → the TFU output ≠ what the descriptor reads (TFU/blit layout is the culprit);
>   AND you now have a **shippable CPU-tile demo fallback** (textured vkQuake on HDMI, slower upload).
> - **Still striped** → the descriptor params are wrong independent of the upload path; the TFU is a
>   red herring and the Mesa dive should target IMAGE-CREATION (`v3dv_image` slice height/uif_height),
>   not the blit.
> That boot can't come back ambiguous; start the next session with it.
>
> **NEXT (the original cache-fence reasoning, now refuted — kept for the record):** between the TFU copy and the sampling render submit,
> add an **L2T flush + TMU cache invalidate** (`SLCACTL` with the TMU/L2T bits) and/or fence on
> **TFU completion** before the render issues TMU fetches. Reference `external/mesa`
> `src/broadcom/vulkan` (v3dv TFU path: how it fences TFU→sample) and `external/linux` v3d
> (`v3d_sched`/TFU IRQ + L2T flush sequencing). Validate by a vkQuake autostart boot — striping
> should resolve to clean textures on HDMI. Probes committed: coord `7e3d1f6`/`c5c1baf`/`123f9bf`
> (winsys `TFU vcheck`). This is the LAST known blocker to textured vkQuake.
>
> ---
> **STATUS (2026-06-26): 2D GPU RASTER PROVEN ON HW; PAUSED at the texture-upload gap.**
> Since this scaffold doc, vkQuake advanced well past init: Vulkan fully initializes on
> the V3D, the per-frame loop / present / projection / back-face-cull are all fixed, and
> a GPU 2D quad renders via Vulkan on the V3D (HW-proven). The **sole remaining blocker is
> the no-WSI winsys texture-copy gap**: `DRM_V3D_SUBMIT_TFU` is a no-op on the Phoenix
> winsys and the CL meta-copy fallback also fails to land textures, so no texture data
> reaches the GPU images → no recognizable Quake content yet. The fix is a proper
> buffer→image copy in `v3d_phoenix_winsys.c` (a focused session). vkQuake is task #29,
> PAUSED; the GL Quake flagship is unaffected. See `docs/done/2026-06-26-risky-items-results.md`

**Date:** 2026-06-23
**Type:** IMPLEMENTATION (host-side build scaffolding) + gap scoping
**Scope:** ADDITIVE. Does NOT touch the GLQuake flagship (`tools/quakespasm-port`, the GL
path) or the main image build. Host-side only — no Pi boot (UART owned by the main agent).
Builds on the HW-validated V3DV ICD (Tier-4b, 2026-06-23): `libv3dv-phoenix.a` +
`libv3d-phoenix.a` back-end.

> **UPDATE 2026-06-25 — REAL SPIR-V SHADERS + FULL CHAIN REBUILT 0-UNDEFINED FROM SCRATCH.**
> The night-audit "no glslang" premise was stale: `glslangValidator` 11:16.2.0 + `spirv-opt`
> (SPIRV-Tools v2026.1) ARE on this host. Re-ran `gen-vkquake-shaders.py` → **all 41 shaders
> compiled to REAL SPIR-V** (magic `0x07230203`, no 20-byte placeholders), matching vkQuake's
> **authoritative `external/vkquake/meson.build` recipe exactly** (NOT the legacy
> `Shaders/compile.sh`, which hardcodes a 2017 `VULKAN_SDK=~/VulkanSDK/1.0.26.0` path and is
> dead). The meson recipe per shader is: `glslangValidator -V --quiet [--target-env vulkan1.1
> for *sops*] -o X.spv INPUT` **then `spirv-opt -Os --canonicalize-ids --strip-debug X.spv -o
> X.spv` on EVERY shader** (the `--canonicalize-ids --strip-debug` variant is taken because
> spirv-opt advertises `--canonicalize-ids`, i.e. glslang ≥ 16.0 — true here). The earlier §D
> note that *only* the sops variants need spirv-opt was wrong on two counts: the pass runs on
> all 41, and the load-bearing sops flag is `--target-env vulkan1.1`, not a spirv-opt option.
> Updated `gen-vkquake-shaders.py` to emit that exact glslang+spirv-opt pipeline (mode now
> prints `REAL (glslangValidator +spirv-opt -Os --canonicalize-ids --strip-debug)`); the
> optimize/strip pass is non-functional (shaders render identically) but makes the embedded
> bytes byte-faithful to the upstream build and ~40% smaller (e.g. `alias_frag` 3304→1832 B).
> `vkquake_shaders.c` (real optimized bytes) is committed for reproducibility.

> The three `/tmp` libs had been cleared, so the WHOLE chain was rebuilt host-side and

---

## 1. Where the source is

- **Fetched** (internet was available this session): `external/vkquake/` —
  `git clone --depth 1 github.com/Novum/vkQuake`, master `9be3a5a`. Sibling of
  `external/quakespasm`, `external/mesa`, `external/linux`.
- Engine sources: `external/vkquake/Quake/*.c` (97 `.c`). Authoritative build set is the
  meson `srcs` list in `external/vkquake/meson.build`.
- Shaders: `external/vkquake/Shaders/*.{vert,frag,comp}` (41 GLSL), compiled to SPIR-V
  then `bintoc`-embedded into generated `.c`. `Shaders/Compiled/{Debug,Release}/` are
  **empty** in the checkout (only `.gitkeep`) — SPIR-V must be built (see §5, build-infra).

**Note on the plan's "no compute" assumption (`docs/inprogress/2026-06-16-...plan.md`
§1.4):** FALSE for modern master. vkQuake uses compute (`vkCmdDispatch`, the
`*_comp` shaders: lightmap updates, `cs_tex_warp`, `indirect`/`indirect_clear`),
indirect draws (`vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect`), buffer-device-address, push descriptors,
and even RT-accel-structure debug paths. These are loaded via `fp*` pointers and gated
behind feature checks at runtime, so they are **not link symbols** and do **not** block
the host-side build. Whether V3DV supports them is a *runtime* question (out of scope —
no Pi boot). Flag for Tier-5 feature-scoping: the renderer must be steered onto a path
V3DV supports (classic raster, no compute lightmaps / no RT), likely via vkQuake cvars
(`r_rtshadows 0`, software/compute-lightmap fallbacks) or by stubbing the compute path.

## 2. The build scaffold (all new, under `tools/vkquake-port/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `build-vkquake-phoenix.py` | Mirrors `build-quakespasm-phoenix.py`. Probe-compiles the 72 portable engine TUs; `--link` does the whole-archive link-drive against the V3DV ICD + back-end and dumps the undefined closure. |
| `gen-vk-trampolines.py` | Parses `vulkan_core.h` prototypes; emits public `vk*` trampolines for the 75 core commands vkQuake calls directly (it does NOT use `VK_NO_PROTOTYPES`). |
| `vk_trampolines.c` | GENERATED (75 commands). Each forwards through the ICD dispatch (aliased to `v3dv_GetInstanceProcAddr` by the existing `tools/v3d-driver-port/vk_icd_link.c`). A Mesa ICD does NOT export public `vk*` symbols, so without this layer every direct core call is undefined at link. **Resolver split is load-bearing and HW-proven by `v3dv_harness.c`:** global cmds → `vkGetInstanceProcAddr(NULL,…)`; instance/phys-dev cmds → `vkGetInstanceProcAddr(g_vk_instance,…)`; **device cmds (VkDevice/VkQueue/VkCommandBuffer first arg, e.g. `vkQueueSubmit`/`vkCmd*`) → `vkGetDeviceProcAddr(g_vk_device,…)`** — instance-proc-addr returns NULL for device commands in a loader-less ICD (the harness proved calling that NULL = pc=0 abort). `g_vk_instance`/`g_vk_device` are published by the vid shim right after `vkCreateInstance`/`vkCreateDevice`. |
| `sdl-shim/SDL.h` | Grown SDL2-compat shim (superset of the quakespasm one): SDL2 threading TYPES (`SDL_mutex/cond/sem/Thread` — quakedef.h aliases SDL3→SDL2 names onto these), `SDL_MUTEX_MAXWAIT`, `SDL_GetPrefPath`, `SDL_RWsize` + RWops, `SDL_PRIs64/u64/u32`, `SDL_GetMouseState` (SDL2 `int*` form). |
| `vkq_phoenix_compat.h` | Force-included into every TU. Pulls `<arm_neon.h>` (mathlib.h auto-#defines USE_SIMD/USE_NEON on aarch64 but never includes the intrinsics header — relies on a PCH upstream); declares the libphoenix `<math.h>` gaps and the `struct ipv6_mreq` netinet gap. |
| `undefined-symbols.txt` | Saved snapshot of the 174-symbol whole-archive undefined closure (the gap inventory). |

## 3. How far compilation/link got

- **Compile: 72/72 portable engine TUs OK** (+ the trampoline TU). Net-new TUs vs
  quakespasm-port that now compile: `gl_heap hash_map lodepng mdfour mem palette pr_ext
  quakedef r_part_fte snd_umx snd_wave tasks`. The entire Vulkan renderer
  (`gl_rmain/gl_draw/gl_screen/gl_sky/gl_warp/gl_texmgr/gl_mesh/r_world/r_brush/r_alias/
  r_part/r_part_fte/...`) compiles against the Vulkan headers + shim.
- **Link (whole-archive): 174 undefined symbols** — NONE are V3DV or v3d-back-end symbols
  (the ICD closure links clean). All 174 are the platform-shim + shader + libc surface in §4.

> **Method note (important, was a trap):** a *bare* archive link (`gcc -o elf lib.a ...`)
> only pulls members crt0's `main` reference reaches — i.e. almost nothing — and
> falsely reports "1 undefined: `main`". The real closure requires
> `-Wl,--whole-archive libvkquake.a -Wl,--no-whole-archive` so every engine TU enters the
> link. `build-vkquake-phoenix.py --link` does this.

## 4. Gap inventory (the 174 undefined symbols), bucketed

### A. Platform shims — LARGELY PORTABLE from `tools/quakespasm-port/platform/` (reuse)
- **`Sys_*` (23):** `Sys_DoubleTime Sys_Printf Sys_Error Sys_Quit Sys_Sleep
  Sys_FileOpenRead/Write Sys_FileRead/Write/Seek/Close Sys_filelength Sys_fseek/ftell
  Sys_FileType Sys_mkdir Sys_ConsoleInput Sys_SendKeyEvents Sys_MemFileOpenRead
  Sys_PinCurrentThread Sys_StackTrace Sys_DebugBreak Sys_IsInDebugger`. Quakespasm-port's
  `pl_phoenix_sys.c` covers most; the file-I/O + `Sys_PinCurrentThread` (thread affinity,
  can be a no-op) + debugger hooks (no-op) are deltas.
- **`IN_*` (8):** `IN_Init/Shutdown/Activate/Deactivate/Commands/Move/ClearStates/
  UpdateInputMode`. Reuse `pl_phoenix_in.c` (`/dev/kbd0` decoder); `IN_UpdateInputMode`
  is a vkQuake addition (small).
- **`SNDDMA_*` (7):** `SNDDMA_Init/Shutdown/GetDMAPos/Submit/LockBuffer/Block/Unblock`.
  Reuse/adapt `pl_phoenix_snd.c` (the audio driver `/dev/audio0` exists — see MEMORY
  rpi4-audio). `BlockSound/UnblockSound` are small additions.

### B. SDL2 threading + path bodies — NET-NEW (I declared them in SDL.h; must implement)
- `SDL_CreateMutex SDL_LockMutex SDL_UnlockMutex SDL_CreateCond SDL_CondWait
  SDL_CondWaitTimeout SDL_CondBroadcast SDL_CreateSemaphore SDL_SemPost SDL_SemWait
  SDL_SemTryWait SDL_Delay SDL_GetCPUCount SDL_CreateThread SDL_DetachThread
  SDL_GetMouseState SDL_GetPrefPath SDL_free` (18).
- These map cleanly onto Phoenix `sys/threads.h` (`mutexCreate/Lock`, `condCreate/Wait`,
  `semaphoreCreate/Up/Down`, `beginthread`). Write `pl_phoenix_sdlcompat.c`. `tasks.c`
  (vkQuake's job system) is the main consumer — it is the one genuinely new threading
  dependency vs. quakespasm. `SDL_GetCPUCount` → return 1 (or the real core count;
  scheduler is cpu0-only per SMP findings). `SDL_GetMouseState`/`SDL_GetPrefPath` belong
  in the input/sys shims.

### C. Vulkan vid shim — NET-NEW, THE LONG POLE (replaces `gl_vidsdl.c`)
- `VID_Init VID_Shutdown VID_Restart VID_Toggle VID_Lock`; `GL_BeginRendering
  GL_EndRendering GL_WaitForDeviceIdle GL_UpdateDescriptorSets GL_SetObjectName
  GL_SynchronizeEndRenderingTask`; globals — **two distinct classes (verified against
  `undefined-symbols.txt`):** (a) GENUINELY UNDEFINED, the shim must **define** them:
  `vid modestate isDedicated r_usesops prev_end_rendering_task`; (b) TENTATIVE/COMMON
  (resolve at link, absent from the undefined list), the shim need only **initialize**:
  `vulkan_globals` + the `num_vulkan_*_allocations` / `total_device_vulkan_allocation_size`
  counters; `M_Menu_Video_f M_Video_Draw M_Video_Key`
  (video menu — can stub); `PL_GetClipboardData SCR_ScreenShot_f` (small); `net_drivers
  net_landrivers net_numdrivers net_numlandrivers` (net registry — comes from the net
  platform glue `pl_linux`/`net_bsd`, replace with the loopback-only table from
  quakespasm-port's `pl_phoenix_stubs.c`).
- This `pl_phoenix_vk_vid.c` is the bulk of the new work: it owns `vkCreateInstance`
  (then publishes `g_vk_instance`), device/queue/swapchain bring-up, the fb0 swapchain
  (plan §3), `GL_BeginRendering/EndRendering` (per-frame command-buffer + present), and
  the `vulkan_globals` table the whole renderer reads. Mirror upstream `gl_vidsdl.c`'s
  structure, swap SDL_Vulkan_* for the fb0 surface. Plan-§3 swapchain coupling applies.
- **SDL_Vulkan_* surface:** `SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface/GetInstanceExtensions/
  GetDrawableSize/GetVkGetInstanceProcAddr/LoadLibrary` are referenced only in the
  excluded `gl_vidsdl.c`; the replacement vid shim calls our fb0-surface code directly
  and never needs them. (They are NOT in the undefined list precisely because gl_vidsdl
  is excluded.)

### D. Embedded SPIR-V shaders + pak — BUILD-INFRA (80 + 3 of the 174)
- 80 `*_spv` / `*_spv_size` extern arrays (`world_vert_spv`, `alias_frag_spv`,
  `*_comp_spv` lightmap/compute, `postprocess_*`, `sky_*`, `showtris_*`, `wboit_*`, ...)
  and 3 `vkquake_pak*` (the embedded base pak via `mkpak`).
- Upstream builds these by: GLSL → SPIR-V via **glslang** (+ `spirv-opt
  --canonicalize-ids` for the `sops` variants), then `bintoc` (host tool,
  `Shaders/bintoc.c`) emits a `<name>.spv.c` with `const unsigned char name_spv[]` +
  `int name_spv_size`. `embedded_pak.c` similarly from `mkpak` (`Misc/vq_pak/mkpak.c`).
- **glslang / spirv-opt are NOT on this host's PATH** → this is a build-infra prerequisite:
  install/build glslang + spirv-tools (host tools), compile the 41 shaders, run bintoc,
  add the generated `.spv.c` to the build. `bintoc`/`mkpak` themselves compile with the
  host cc (native). Until then the renderer links only with stubbed/zero shader arrays
  (which would render nothing — so this gates any on-HW pixel, but NOT the link scaffold).

### E. libc gaps — SMALL (upstreamable to libphoenix)
- `copysign` — libphoenix `<math.h>` lacks it (has `round/roundf/log2/trunc`; lacks
  `copysign`, also `rint/remainder/log2f/fmin/fmax` were missing as *declarations* but
  DO resolve from libm at link; only `copysign` is truly unresolved at link). Add to
  libphoenix math (the upstreamable fix), or provide in a shim `.c`.
- `pthread_mutex_timedlock` — libphoenix lacks it; reached via `SDL_SemWaitTimeout`/
  tasks.c timeouts. Either implement in `pl_phoenix_sdlcompat.c` over Phoenix cond-timed-
  wait, or add to libphoenix pthread. (Matches the libc-gap-filling pattern the
  quakespasm/X11 ports used.)
- `main` — entry point lives in the excluded `main_sdl.c`; provided by the
  `pl_phoenix_main.c` shim (reuse quakespasm-port's, adapt the init order for the Vulkan
  vid path).

## 5. Concrete next steps (in dependency order)

1. **Write `pl_phoenix_sdlcompat.c`** — the 18 SDL2 threading/path bodies over
   `sys/threads.h` + `pthread_mutex_timedlock`. Smallest, unblocks `tasks.c` at link.
   (Bucket B + the pthread gap in E.)
2. **Port the platform shims** from `tools/quakespasm-port/platform/` — `pl_phoenix_sys.c`
   (+ file-I/O + no-op thread-pin/debugger), `pl_phoenix_in.c` (+ `IN_UpdateInputMode`,
   `SDL_GetMouseState`), `pl_phoenix_snd.c` → `SNDDMA_*`, `pl_phoenix_main.c`,
   `pl_phoenix_stubs.c` (loopback `net_drivers` table). (Buckets A + parts of C/E.)
3. **Add `copysign` to libphoenix math** (or a shim) — one symbol. (Bucket E.)
4. **Build-infra: SPIR-V shaders** — get glslang + spirv-opt on the host, compile the 41
   shaders, run `bintoc`, generate `embedded_pak.c` via `mkpak`, add the `.spv.c` to the
   build. (Bucket D — needed before any real frame, parallelizable with 1–3.)
5. **Write the Vulkan vid shim `pl_phoenix_vk_vid.c`** — the long pole (Bucket C):
   instance/device/queue/swapchain bring-up, the fb0 swapchain (plan §3),
   `GL_BeginRendering/EndRendering`, the `vulkan_globals` table, publish `g_vk_instance`.
   Steer the renderer onto a V3DV-supported feature path (no compute lightmaps / no RT —
   see §1) via cvars/stubs. This is where the plan's Tier-4/5 risk concentrates.
6. **Link to a complete ELF**, then hand to the main agent for on-HW Tier-1 bring-up
   (`vkCreateInstance`/`vkCreateDevice` already HW-proven via `v3dv_harness`; vkQuake adds
   the renderer + swapchain on top).

## 6. Reuse vs. net-new summary (vs `quakespasm-port`)

- **~Free reuse:** engine core, net (loopback), the `Sys_*`/`IN_*` shim skeletons,
  `pl_phoenix_main/sys/in/snd/stubs.c`, the SDL RWops mapping.
- **Net-new:** the SDL2 *threading* bodies (`tasks.c` is vkQuake-only), the Vulkan vid
  shim + fb0 swapchain (replaces the GL `pl_phoenix_vid.c`/`glctx`), the trampoline layer
  (done — generated), the SPIR-V shader build pipeline, the V3DV feature-scoping for
  compute/RT paths.
