# Raspberry Pi 4 / BCM2711 OS Development Guide

A reference for anyone bringing up a new operating system, or porting an
existing one, on the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (or Compute Module 4 / Pi 400).
The target audience is bare-metal OS developers: kernel hackers, RTOS
porters, hypervisor authors, and demo-writers. The guide focuses on
**platform knowledge** — what the SoC does and does not do, what the
firmware leaves behind, what every other working stack agrees on — and
treats Phoenix-RTOS-specific outcomes as case studies / war stories at the
end.

The document was written during the Phoenix-RTOS Pi 4 port and is
deliberately pragmatic: every section starts from "what someone bringing
up their first Pi 4 OS actually needs to know" rather than reproducing
the BCM2711 ARM Peripherals datasheet (which you should also read).

Conventions used below:

- "ARM-side phys" means the **low-peripheral** address mapping used by
  64-bit Linux and almost all bare-metal stacks (peripherals at
  `0xFC000000`–`0xFEFFFFFF`). The legacy "high-peripheral" mode at
  `0x7E000000` exists for 32-bit BCM2835 compatibility; do not use it on
  a new Pi 4 OS.
- DT addresses are quoted in the legacy SoC view (`0x7Dxxxxxx`) when the
  device tree node uses that view, with the ARM-side phys called out
  alongside.
- Errata bit numbers and register encodings come from the Cortex-A72 r0p3
  TRM, ARM Trusted Firmware's `lib/cpus/aarch64/cortex_a72.S`, and the
  Raspberry Pi `armstubs/armstub8.S`. Cross-check against your own
  silicon revision before trusting any single source.


## Pi 4 / BCM2711 at a glance

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| SoC | Broadcom BCM2711 (B0 / C0 stepping in shipping units) |
| CPU | Cortex-A72 r0p3, 4 cores, ARMv8-A, 1.5 GHz (turbo up to 1.8 GHz with overvolt) |
| Caches | L1I+L1D 48 KB each per core, cluster L2 1 MB (A72-internal — see "Cache topology") |
| Memory controller | LPDDR4-3200, 1/2/4/8 GB SKUs |
| GPU | VideoCore VI (VC6) — runs `start4.elf` and remains live after handoff |
| Interrupt controller | GIC-400 (GICv2), distributor + 4 CPU interfaces |
| Generic timer | ARMv8 architectural timer, 54 MHz reference |
| Boot CPU | VPU (VideoCore) — loads firmware, ARM cores wait for release |
| Ethernet | Broadcom GENET v5 MAC + BCM54213PE PHY over RGMII (1 Gbps) |
| Wi-Fi / BT | BCM43455 (SDIO + UART for BT) |
| USB | xHCI via VLI VL805 (USB 3.0 host) behind the integrated PCIe RC |
| Display | 2× HDMI via VC6 (driven by firmware until you take it over) |

The ARM cores are **not** the boot CPU. The VideoCore VPU is. The VPU
brings up DRAM, loads firmware, parses `config.txt`, patches the device
tree, loads the kernel image (or armstub), and finally releases the A72
cluster to a known PA. Anything the ARM cores want to know about the
hardware comes from one of three sources: the device tree the firmware
patched, the property mailbox interface to the VC6, or direct MMIO. There
is no "BIOS" or ACPI on Pi 4 (UEFI is achievable via `pftf/RPi4` but is
not the default path).


## Memory map (low-peripheral mode, ARM-side)

```
0x0000_0000 - 0x0000_00FF   armstub / spin-table area
0x0000_0100 - 0x0007_FFFF   firmware-reserved low-memory scratch
0x0000_8000 - 0x0007_FFFF   typical kernel load address (32-bit Linux)
0x0008_0000 - 0x????_????   typical kernel load address (64-bit, kernel8.img)
0x???? .... - 0x3B3F_FFFF   first ARM-visible DRAM bank (size = ARM_total - GPU_reserve)
0x3B40_0000 - 0x3FFF_FFFF   76 MB GPU reserve (default; tunable via gpu_mem)
0x4000_0000 - 0xFBFF_FFFF   second ARM-visible DRAM bank (3008 MB on 4 GB SKUs)
0xFC00_0000 - 0xFCFF_FFFF   reserved (some SoC subsystems)
0xFD00_0000 - 0xFD9F_FFFF   PCIe + GENET + SDIO + thermal + RNG + ...
0xFE00_0000 - 0xFEFF_FFFF   classic VC4 peripherals (UARTs, GPIO, USB2 EHCI/OHCI,
                            mailbox, SDHCI, DMA, watchdog, framebuffer)
0xFF80_0000 - 0xFF8F_FFFF   ARM-local: GIC-400 distributor + CPU interface
```

Note that the 4 GB SKU has **two ARM-visible DRAM banks** described by
**two separate `/memory@*` device tree nodes**. Any parser that picks up
only the first node will silently see ~948 MB of RAM and lose the upper
3 GB. This is one of the most common Pi 4 porting pitfalls.

The split between the two banks is fixed by SoC routing, not by firmware
config. `total_mem=` in `config.txt` can only cap the visible RAM; it
cannot enlarge or shift the banks.

The 8 GB SKU exposes a third bank above 4 GB. As of writing, Phoenix has
not tested that path; behaviour of code that assumes ≤4 GB on 8 GB units
is undefined (most likely it will see two banks and ignore the third).


## Boot pipeline & handoff

Pi 4 boot is a multi-stage handoff. Each stage can leave invisible state
(cache lines, MMIO writes, GIC interrupt-pending bits, DMA descriptor
rings) that bites later stages. Always reason about what your
predecessor left behind.

```

### What the firmware loads, by default

| File | Default load PA | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bootcode.bin` | (EEPROM on Pi 4; FAT fallback) | First-stage VPU loader |
| `start4.elf` | (VPU side) | Main VPU firmware |
| `fixup4.dat` | (VPU side) | Memory-split parameters for `start4.elf` |
| `bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb` | (parsed in VPU memory; pointer passed) | Device tree |
| `armstub8.bin` (or `armstub=...`) | `0x00000000` | First code A72 core 0 runs |
| `kernel8.img` (`kernel=`) | `0x00080000` (override with `kernel_address=`) | 64-bit kernel |
| `initramfs <file> <addr>` | `<addr>` | Optional ramdisk |
| `overlays/*.dtbo` | (merged into DTB) | DT overlays |

The `start4cd.elf` / `fixup4cd.dat` pair is a stripped firmware (~850 KB)
that disables hardware-decoder bring-up, 3D bring-up, and a few other
non-essential paths. It is a useful experiment when you suspect VC6 is
interfering with your DMA or peripheral programming.

### Exception levels and CPU state at handoff

By default the firmware enters the armstub at **EL3** with caches and
MMU off, MMU disabled, all DAIF masked. The canonical Raspberry Pi
armstub then sets up GIC, drops to EL2 (the level Linux expects), and
the kernel decides whether to stay at EL2 or drop to EL1.

You can replace the armstub with `armstub=<your-binary>` in `config.txt`.
Most OS ports do this and inline the EL3-only initialisation (errata
workarounds, L2 cache RAM timing, generic timer, GIC) into their own
armstub so they keep tight control over what runs before the kernel.

### Spin-table secondary release protocol

The canonical Pi 4 armstub leaves cores 1, 2, and 3 spinning in a
`WFE` loop polling four memory locations near the start of the armstub
image (typically at offsets `0xd8`, `0xe0`, `0xe8` for `spin_cpu1`,
`spin_cpu2`, `spin_cpu3`; offset `0xf8` is `dtb_ptr32`). To release a
secondary, write its release address to the corresponding slot and
`SEV`. The released core picks the address up, branches to it, and your
kernel takes over.

The device tree's `/cpus/cpu@N` nodes have
`enable-method = "spin-table"` and a `cpu-release-addr` property that
points at the slot. Read the DTB; don't hard-code offsets.

Important: the firmware does **not** issue a `dsb ish` between writing
the spin-table magic and releasing core 0, and Linux/U-Boot historically
issued a self-CPU writeback to make the writes visible to other cores
when caches were off. If your armstub runs with caches off (almost all
of them do), make sure the kernel cleans the spin-table cache line
**before** doing the release write.

### DTB pointer convention

There is no standard register containing the DTB pointer at A72 entry
on the canonical Pi 4 armstub: the firmware writes the DTB physical
address into the armstub's `dtb_ptr32` field at offset `0xf8`. Custom
armstubs typically forward that pointer to the kernel through `x0`
(Linux ABI) or through a known fixed slot in low memory. Pick a
convention and document it; the device tree pointer is the only way to
know which DRAM banks are real, where peripherals live, and what your
MAC address is.


## Critical EL3 / armstub initialization

This is the **single biggest landmine** in Pi 4 bring-up. Every working
Pi 4 bare-metal stack — the canonical Raspberry Pi armstub, ARM Trusted
Firmware (`plat/rpi`), Circle, U-Boot, Linux's `head.S` when chain-loaded
by U-Boot — performs a small fixed set of EL3-only writes. Skipping or
mis-encoding any of them can produce a system that boots **on most
silicon** and crashes on yours.

### Cortex-A72 r0p3 errata workarounds

The errata documented for the A72 r0p3 are listed in the ARM Cortex-A72
MPCore Processor Software Developers Errata Notice. The two most
commonly applied on BCM2711 are:

- **Erratum 859971** — speculative instruction prefetch into XN page can
  corrupt instructions. Workaround:
  `CPUACTLR_EL1[32] = 1` (DIS_INSTR_PREFETCH).
- **Erratum 1319367** — speculative AT (address-translation) instruction
  during context switch can populate the TLB with stale entries.
  Workaround: `CPUACTLR_EL1[46] = 1` (DIS_HW_PAGE_AGGREGATION).

The encoding for both is the implementation-defined system register
`CPUACTLR_EL1`, accessed as `S3_1_C15_C2_0`. The companion register
`CPUECTLR_EL1` is `S3_1_C15_C2_1`. The encoding `S3_1_C15_C2_2`
(sometimes mis-named "CPUACTLR2_EL1" in third-party headers) is **not
documented** on Cortex-A72 r0p3; writes to it are not guaranteed to
have any effect, and may silently corrupt some other state. ARM Trusted
Firmware's `cortex_a72.S errata_a72_1319367_wa` confirms the correct
target is `CPUACTLR_EL1[46]`.

A typical EL3 sequence (pseudo-assembly):

```
    mrs   x0, S3_1_C15_C2_0           // CPUACTLR_EL1
    orr   x0, x0, #(1 << 32)          // 859971
    orr   x0, x0, #(1 << 46)          // 1319367
    msr   S3_1_C15_C2_0, x0
    isb
```

`CPUACTLR_EL1` and `CPUECTLR_EL1` **trap from EL1** on Cortex-A72 r0p3
unless `ACTLR_EL2.{CPUACTLR,CPUECTLR}` grants access. The simplest fix
is to do all the impl-defined writes in your armstub (at EL3) before
you ever drop to EL2 or EL1.

### L2 cache RAM timing (BCM2711-specific)

The A72 cluster's L2 cache RAM needs explicit timing on BCM2711's
1.5 GHz silicon. The TRM default of 2-cycle data RAM latency does not
meet timing; cacheable loads after `SCTLR.C=1` return corrupt data.

```
    mrs   x0, S3_1_C11_C0_2           // L2CTLR_EL1
    orr   x0, x0, #(0x22)             // Data RAM Latency=3, Setup=1
    msr   S3_1_C11_C0_2, x0
    isb
```

This is set by:

- `raspberrypi/tools` `armstubs/armstub8.S`
- ARM Trusted Firmware `plat/rpi/common/aarch64/plat_helpers.S`
- Circle `boot/armstub/armstub8.S`
- U-Boot `arch/arm/cpu/armv8/start.S` when chain-loaded

If you write your own armstub, **program L2CTLR_EL1 = 0x22**. The
symptom of skipping it is described in the war story at the end of
this document; expect days-to-weeks of false leads in kernel cache code.

### CPUECTLR_EL1 — SMPEN and L2 prefetch

```
    mrs   x0, S3_1_C15_C2_1           // CPUECTLR_EL1
    orr   x0, x0, #(1 << 6)           // SMPEN
    bic   x0, x0, #(3 << 38)          // clear L2 store prefetch
    orr   x0, x0, #(3 << 32)          // L1 instruction-fetch distance
    msr   S3_1_C15_C2_1, x0
    isb
```

`SMPEN` is required for any cache-coherent multi-core operation. Leaving
it clear and then enabling D-caches gives you incoherent caches across
cores.

### Generic timer

```
    msr   CNTFRQ_EL0,   x_19200000_or_54000000   // see below
    msr   CNTVOFF_EL2,  xzr
    mrs   x0, CNTHCTL_EL2
    orr   x0, x0, #3                  // EL1PCEN | EL1PCTEN
    msr   CNTHCTL_EL2, x0
```

`CNTFRQ_EL0` on Pi 4 is `54000000` (54 MHz) by default. `CNTVOFF_EL2`
must be cleared before the first read of `CNTVCT_EL0`; otherwise the
virtual timer is offset by whatever the reset value happened to be.

### GICv2 distributor + CPU interface

The GIC-400 lives at ARM-side phys `0xFF841000` (distributor) and
`0xFF842000` (CPU interface). The bringup is the standard GICv2 dance:

- Distributor: set `GICD_CTLR.EnableGrp0 = 1`, configure all SPIs as
  level-low (default) or as documented in the DT.
- CPU interface (per-core): `GICC_PMR = 0xFF` (lowest priority that
  still passes), `GICC_CTLR.EnableGrp0 = 1`, optionally `BPR = 0`.

Cores 1-3 each need their own `GICC_*` programming after release; the
armstub typically does CPU-interface setup right before dropping the
exception level.

### SCTLR_EL2 / SCTLR_EL1 RES1 bits

Several SCTLR bits are reserved-1 on AArch64. The conservative baseline
that matches Linux + ARM Trusted Firmware is `0x30C50830` for SCTLR_EL2
(caches off) and `0x30D50838` for SCTLR_EL1 (caches off, alignment-fault
disabled). Bits 4, 5, 11, 16, 18, 22, 28, 29 are RES1 on A72. Check
the TRM for your exact silicon; using a value that is missing required
bits is silently wrong on A72 even though it works on Cortex-A53.

### Reference armstubs

Reading working code is the fastest way to internalise the EL3 setup:

- [raspberrypi/tools `armstubs/armstub8.S`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/blob/master/armstubs/armstub8.S)
  — the canonical Pi reference.
- [ARM Trusted Firmware `plat/rpi`](https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/tree/master/plat/rpi)
  — `plat_reset_handler` for RPi3/RPi4 captures the errata sequence.
- [Circle `boot/armstub/armstub8.S`](https://github.com/rsta2/circle/blob/master/boot/armstub/armstub8.S)
  — independent reimplementation, similar shape.
- [U-Boot `arch/arm/cpu/armv8/start.S`](https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot/blob/master/arch/arm/cpu/armv8/start.S)
  — drops to EL2 from whatever level it entered at.


## DRAM, caches, MMU

### Cache topology

There is no separate "system L2" cache on BCM2711. The phrase "1 MB
system L2 cache" in older BCM datasheets is a copy-paste artefact from
the BCM2835 era. On BCM2711:

- Each A72 core has private 48 KB L1I + 48 KB L1D.
- The four-core A72 cluster shares a 1 MB L2 (cluster-private; the
  GPU/VPU does not see it).
- Everything that's not cached in L1/L2 sits in DRAM (or peripheral
  MMIO).

### Memory-type policy

For a first-cut MMU map:

- DRAM (both banks): **Normal, Inner WB-WA, Outer WB-WA, shareable**.
- All peripheral MMIO (`0xFC000000`–`0xFEFFFFFF`, `0xFD000000`–`0xFD9FFFFF`,
  `0xFF800000`–`0xFF8FFFFF`): **Device-nGnRnE** (or `nGnRE` if you need
  early-write completion).
- **GPU reserve** (`0x3B400000`–`0x3FFFFFFF` by default): **Device** or
  **Normal Non-Cacheable**, never Normal-Cacheable. The VPU writes to
  this region after handoff (HDMI scanout buffer, mailbox response
  buffers if you put them here); a cacheable alias on the ARM side will
  see stale data and may produce dirty lines that overwrite the VPU's
  writes on eviction.

### DMA-coherency

Peripherals on BCM2711 DMA to/from DRAM **without** the help of a system
MMU or IOMMU. Each block has its own bus-address view:

- VC4-era peripherals on the `0xFE000000` bus see ARM-side phys + an
  offset that the firmware programs in the system MMU at boot. For most
  blocks this is a 1:1 mapping in low-peri mode.
- GENET and PCIe go through the SCB (System Coherent Bus) and can use a
  **35-bit DMA address space**: `addr_hi` is a 3-bit field in the
  descriptor. On boards with ≤4 GB DRAM the high bits are always 0; on
  >4 GB boards (and on Compute Module 4 paired with 8 GB Lite SO-DIMM
  variants) they matter.

The B0 silicon stepping has a quirk where PCIe inbound DMA above 3 GB
silently fails. The C0 stepping fixes it. The safe pattern is to keep
your packet/transfer buffers in the low DRAM bank (below 0xC0000000) or
to program the inbound BAR (RC_BAR2) at 0 with size ≥ ARM-visible DRAM.

### MMU bring-up gotchas

- Identity-map the entire ARM-visible DRAM range up front. Identity is
  the easiest place to start; you can lay a high-VA kernel mapping on
  top later.
- The transition from MMU-off to MMU-on is the single most failure-prone
  step. Recommended pattern: build the page tables with caches off,
  flush set/way (Linux uses `__inval_dcache_area`), then SCTLR write in
  one shot. Some Pi 4 stacks (including Phoenix's plo) cannot
  successfully enable `M|C|I` in a single shot on A72 r0p3 + BCM2711
  silicon — staged enable (`M` first, then `C|I` later from a known-good
  cacheable PC) is a workaround if you hit that.
- Always pre-flip `ic ialluis; dsb ish; tlbi vmalle1is; dsb ish; isb`
  and post-flip `isb; ic iallu; dsb nsh; isb` around the SCTLR write.

### Pi 4 4 GB DTB topology

The 4 GB SKU exposes its memory as two DT nodes:

```
memory@0       { reg = <0x0 0x00000000 0x0 0x3B400000>; };
memory@40000000{ reg = <0x0 0x40000000 0x0 0xBC000000>; };
```

A DTB parser that walks only the first `/memory*` node will silently
miss the upper bank. The 8 GB SKU adds a third node beyond 4 GB.


## DTB layout & VideoCore handoff

On Pi 4 the device tree is **not optional**. Even minimal bare-metal
demos need it to discover:

- Memory bank layout (multiple `/memory@*` nodes).
- The firmware-injected MAC address (`/ethernet@7d580000/local-mac-address`).
- Board-revision-dependent peripheral wiring (e.g. which `i2c-NN` is
  routed to the GPIO header on this PCB rev).
- Compatibility strings to disambiguate Pi 4 vs Pi 400 vs CM4.

### What the firmware patches

When `start4.elf` parses the DTB it adds or replaces:

- `/memory@*` nodes for each ARM-visible DRAM bank.
- `/chosen/bootargs`, `/chosen/linux,initrd-*`, `/chosen/kaslr-seed`.
- `local-mac-address` for the GENET and BCM43455 nodes (read from OTP).
- `/aliases/serial0` etc. depending on `dtparam=` and `dtoverlay=` lines
  in `config.txt`.
- The full set of clock and pinctrl nodes the kernel needs.

### VideoCore remains live after handoff

This catches many porters off-guard: the VC6 does **not** halt when it
hands off to ARM. It continues to:

- Drive HDMI (display scanout reads from the GPU reserve in DRAM).
- Answer mailbox property requests on channel 8.
- Respond to firmware notifications (e.g. `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET`).
- Manage thermals and clocks (you can request changes, but the VPU is
  the actual policy owner).

So the GPU reserve range is **shared with the VPU**, and the mailbox is
how you keep talking to it. Treat the GPU reserve as Device memory and
respect the firmware's continued ownership.


## Mailbox property interface

The mailbox at ARM-side phys `0xFE00B880` is the VideoCore property
interface. Channel 8 is "Property tags (ARM → VC)"; channel 9 is "VC →
ARM". Each request is a buffer of 32-bit words: total size, request
code, then one or more tag triples (tag, value-buffer-size,
request-size, value-words), terminated by an end tag (`0x0`).

Tags every Pi 4 OS port ends up using:

| Tag | Name | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x00010003` | `GET_BOARD_MAC_ADDRESS` | Read the unit's MAC from OTP |
| `0x00010002` | `GET_BOARD_SERIAL` | Read the board serial |
| `0x00010004` | `GET_BOARD_REVISION` | Disambiguate Pi 4 / 400 / CM4 / 8GB |
| `0x00000001` | `GET_FIRMWARE_VERSION` | Diagnostics |
| `0x00038041` | `SET_POWER_STATE` | Power-up/down USB, SD, etc. |
| `0x00030058` | `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET` | Re-load VL805 firmware after PCIe re-init |
| `0x00040001` | `ALLOCATE_FRAMEBUFFER` | Open a framebuffer |
| `0x00040003` | `GET_PHYSICAL_DISPLAY_W_H` | HDMI resolution discovery |

The protocol is documented at
[raspberrypi/firmware mailboxes](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/wiki/Mailboxes).

Address constraints:

- The request buffer pointer is written to `MBOX_WRITE` shifted left by
  4 and OR'd with the channel number. So the buffer must be **16-byte
  aligned**.
- The buffer's **bus address** is what the VPU expects, not the ARM
  phys. On BCM2711 in low-peri mode the bus address for DRAM is
  `phys | 0xC0000000` for the legacy mailbox; this is one of the few
  places the legacy bus alias is still load-bearing.
- The buffer must be in a region the VPU can read — typically the GPU
  reserve, but any ARM-visible DRAM works as long as you clean the cache
  before sending and invalidate after the response arrives.


## PCIe + USB (xHCI / VL805)

### PCIe controller

BCM2711's PCIe is a **single-lane Gen 2** root complex at ARM-side phys
`0xFD500000`. It is the only PCIe controller on the SoC. Pi 4-B uses it
to expose a single device — the VLI VL805 USB 3.0 host controller —
behind it on bus 1. Compute Module 4 routes the PCIe lane out to the
edge connector so it can carry any PCIe device.

The outbound window is a fixed CPU range `0x600000000`–`0x7FFFFFFFF`
(36-bit CPU PA) mapping to PCIe bus addresses starting at
`0xF8000000`. The window base/limit registers are programmed in
**1 MiB granularity** with the math `phys >> 20`; minimum window size
is 1 MiB.

The bring-up sequence that every working stack agrees on:

1. **Reset the RC** (`MISC_PCIE_CTRL.PCIE_BRIDGE_SW_INIT`).
2. **PERST# assert**, wait, **PERST# deassert**, wait **100 ms** per
   PCIe CEM spec §2.6.2.
3. **Inbound BAR (`RC_BAR2`) = 0, size ≥ ARM-visible DRAM**. RC_BAR2
   offset must be **0** — the VPU's xHCI reset firmware assumes
   bus == CPU 1:1 for the inbound translation
   ([firmware#1495](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1495)).
4. **Outbound window** (`PCIE_MISC_CPU_2_PCIE_MEM_WIN0_*`), 1-MiB-granular.
5. **MISC_CTRL** flags: `PCIE_RCB_MPS_MODE`, `PCIE_RCB_64B_MODE`, set
   `SCB0_SIZE` to `log2(SCB0_size) - 15` (e.g. 17 for 4 GiB).
6. **Poll link-up**, then enumerate via the controller's indexed-config
   interface (BCM2711 PCIe config space is **not** ECAM).
7. **Program BARs** with bus addresses inside the outbound window.
   Use `MEM_TYPE_64` and split into `BAR0 = lower_32 | MEM_TYPE_64`,
   `BAR1 = upper_32`.
8. **Command register**: set Memory-enable and Bus-master.
9. **Mailbox `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET`** (tag `0x00030058`, channel 8,
   payload `(bus<<20) | (slot<<15) | (func<<12)`). This causes the VPU
   to re-load VL805's SRAM. **Do not** call it more than once
   ([firmware#1617](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1617));
   firmware state goes stale.
10. **First MMIO read** of VL805 BAR0 (HCIVERSION). If you see
    `0xDEADDEAD`, see the next subsection.

### The 0xDEADDEAD BAR readback — multiple silicon causes

The literal sentinel `0xDEADDEAD` on a BAR read comes from at least
three distinct silicon conditions on BCM2711, and you should rule out
each before iterating on driver code. (Cross-reference for the
canonical write-up: Phoenix's
`memory/project_bcm2711_pcie_64bit_bug.md`.)

**Cause A — oversized BAR mapping.** VL805's BAR0 is exactly **4 KiB**.
If you `mmap` 64 KiB across BAR0, speculative or compiler-coalesced
reads spill past the BAR end into 60 KiB of unmapped space; the
brcmstb PCIe root complex aborts those accesses, and on arm64 the
absorbed external abort surfaces as `0xDEADDEAD`. Fix: probe BAR size
with the write-all-ones / read-back-mask dance and map exactly that.

**Cause B — VL805 AC64 high-half garbage.** VL805 advertises
`HCCPARAMS1.AC64 = 1` but the hardware returns garbage in the high 32
bits of any 64-bit MMIO read. Low 32 bits are correct. Every working
driver (Linux, FreeBSD, Circle, U-Boot, Microsoft's `usbxhci.sys`)
splits 64-bit xHCI registers (CRCR, DCBAAP, ERDP, ERSTBA) into two
32-bit reads as a workaround. Treat AC64 as 0 in your xHCI core.

**Cause C — outbound window not covering the access.** A read to a CPU
PA outside the programmed outbound window returns `0xDEADDEAD` on
BCM2711. So does a sub-word access (the controller requires 32-bit
aligned 32-bit MMIO). Recheck `PCIE_MISC_CPU_2_PCIE_MEM_WIN0_*` math
and confirm your accessors are `readl`/`writel`.

**Cause D — incomplete inbound bridge state after `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET`.**
Empirically (Phoenix 2026-05-24): the VPU's xHCI reset path can leave
RC_BAR1/RC_BAR2 in a state that breaks subsequent host-controller
DMA. Symptom: USBSTS sets `HSE` (host system error) when you write
`USBCMD.R/S = 1`. Workaround: re-disable RC_BAR1 and re-program RC_BAR2
**after** the mailbox call. This bug is still partially open at the
time of writing; some boots hit HSE intermittently. Treat the bridge
state as **non-deterministic after `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET`**; defensively
re-validate every BAR you care about before issuing the first DMA.

### Other BCM2711 PCIe quirks

- **ECAM not supported.** Config space is a single 4 KiB movable
  window. You program a target BDF into a config register and access
  the device's config space through the window.
- **No I/O space.** Don't expect or program I/O BARs; the SoC has no
  PCIe I/O range. CM4 panics if a card asks for one.
- **ASPM L1**: BCM2711 advertises L1 substates but Pi engineers
  recommend leaving them disabled. Linux PCI core disables by default
  on this controller.
- **VL805 TRB overfetch**: prefetches up to 4 TRBs past a 4 KiB page
  boundary even when a Link TRB ends the segment. Linux mitigates with
  the `XHCI_TRB_OVERFETCH` quirk; expect to need an equivalent once
  you have transfers running.
- **VL805 link-TRB endpoint context bug**: the controller's
  hardware-maintained endpoint context sticks at the Link TRB address;
  the workaround is to ensure your ring includes a Link TRB at the
  ring-expansion boundary.

### Single-process bus owner is the workable pattern

Splitting "PCIe bring-up" and "xHCI driver" into separate userspace
processes on a microkernel hits a per-process MMIO mapping race on
BCM2711: the second process's `mmap` of the PCIe outbound window
returns `0xDEADDEAD`-pattern reads. Whether this is an MMU/cache
ownership issue or a controller-state issue is unsettled, but **every**
working Pi 4 USB stack we've examined runs PCIe + xHCI in the **same
address space**. Plan for a single-process bus owner from day one if
you're a microkernel.


## GENET (Ethernet)

The Pi 4 onboard Ethernet is **Broadcom GENET v5** (MAC) + **BCM54213PE**
(external gigabit PHY) over RGMII. The GENET MAC sits at ARM-side phys
`0xFD580000`, size 64 KiB. The DT presents it as
`compatible = "brcm,bcm2711-genet-v5"` at SoC view `0x7D580000`.

### Block layout inside the GENET MMIO window

```
0x0000  SYS         system / revision / port-control / flush
0x0040  GR_BRIDGE   global bridge control
0x0080  EXT         external (PHY reset, RGMII OOB, EEE)
0x0200  INTRL2_0    interrupt level-2 set 0 (general / RX-default / TX-default)
0x0240  INTRL2_1    interrupt level-2 set 1 (priority rings)
0x0300  RBUF        RX buffer / packet filters
0x0800  UMAC        UMAC (Unified MAC) — incl. CMD, MAC0/1
0x0E14  UMAC_MDIO   MDIO command register (single-word on v5)
0x2000  RDMA        RX DMA registers + RX BD ring (256 × 12 B inside MMIO)
0x4000  TDMA        TX DMA registers + TX BD ring (256 × 12 B inside MMIO)
0xFC00  HFB         hardware filter blocks
```

The descriptor rings live **inside the GENET MMIO window**, not in
system memory. You write descriptors via `writel`. Only the **packet
payload buffers** are allocated from system DRAM, and only those need
cache-flush dances.

### Interrupts

Two GIC SPIs: 157 (general / RX-default / TX-default) and 158 (priority
rings). The DT records them as
`interrupts = <0 0x9d 4>, <0 0x9e 4>` (SPI number, level-high). On the
GIC SPI numbering used by some kernels, that's IRQ 189 and 190 after
adding the 32 PPI/SGI offset.

### Bring-up sequence

The shortest path to "link-up + one packet TX + one packet RX" is the
following. Subscripts in brackets are the level of detail each existing
driver lands at: **L** = Linux, **F** = FreeBSD, **U** = U-Boot,
**C** = Circle.

1. **Soft-reset UMAC** [L,F,U,C]:
   `UMAC_CMD |= SW_RESET | LCL_LOOP_EN`, dsb, clear both, dsb.
2. **Flush RBUF + TBUF**:
   `SYS_RBUF_FLUSH_CTRL = 1; usleep(10); SYS_RBUF_FLUSH_CTRL = 0;`
   (same for TBUF).
3. **Confirm silicon revision**:
   read `SYS_REV_CTRL`; v5 reports major == 6 in bits 24..27. Accept
   both 5 and 6 (the silicon-IP minor counter has reused both).
4. **MAC address**:
   - **The Pi 4 firmware does NOT pre-program `UMAC_MAC0`/`UMAC_MAC1`**
     with the OTP MAC. Linux reads `local-mac-address` from the DT
     (which the firmware patched), then writes it back to UMAC.
     **U-Boot, Circle, FreeBSD, NetBSD all do read MAC0/MAC1** and
     expect the firmware to have programmed them — that is the
     Pi-3/Pi-zero convention, and it does not hold on Pi 4 in practice.
     If MAC0/MAC1 read as zero, fall back to a mailbox tag-`0x10003`
     call or to a locally-administered MAC for bring-up.
5. **PHY hard reset** [C, partially L]:
   `EXT_GPHY_CTRL |= EXT_GPHY_RESET; usleep(≥10); &= ~EXT_GPHY_RESET`,
   then wait ≥200 µs before MDIO is reliable.
6. **SYS_PORT_CTRL = `PORT_MODE_EXT_GPHY` (3)** [L, U]:
   **mandatory** for Pi 4. The reset default is `0`
   (internal-EPHY) and the MAC silently drops everything you queue if
   it isn't reprogrammed. Symptom: TDMA consumes BDs (CONS_INDEX
   advances) but nothing appears on the wire.
7. **RGMII configuration**:
   `EXT_RGMII_OOB_CTRL |= RGMII_LINK | RGMII_MODE_EN`,
   clear `OOB_DISABLE`, clear `ID_MODE_DIS` for `phy-mode = "rgmii-rxid"`
   (Pi 4's actual DT value — the GENET adds the internal RX delay; TX
   delay comes from the PCB).
   The phrase "Pi 4 phy-mode is plain rgmii" in some older references
   is wrong; the shipping DTB explicitly says `rgmii-rxid`.
8. **MDIO bring-up**:
   `UMAC_MDIO_CMD` (offset `0x0E14`) is a single 32-bit register with
   the layout
   `[31:28] start/busy/fail, [27] RD, [26] WR, [25:21] phy_addr, [20:16] reg, [15:0] data`.
   Linux/U-Boot poll the start/busy bit with a ~20 ms timeout.
9. **PHY init**:
   read PHY ID at MDIO reg 2 + 3 (BCM54213PE returns `0x600D84A2`),
   kick autoneg via BMCR, wait for BMSR link-up (or run a 1 Hz poll
   thread until you wire up the link-status IRQ).
10. **TX ring init** (default queue is **ring 16**):
    - `TDMA_RING_START_ADDR / END_ADDR / READ_PTR / WRITE_PTR / BUF_SIZE`.
    - `TDMA_RING_CFG |= 1 << 16` (enable ring 16).
    - `TDMA_CTRL |= TDMA_EN | (1 << (RBUF_EN_LSB + 16))` — the
      default-queue select bit is at `RBUF_EN_LSB + ring_idx`.
    - `TDMA_SCB_BURST_SIZE = 8` (U-Boot's BCM2711-specific value).
11. **TX a packet**:
    - Copy payload to a DMA-coherent buffer (or use cacheable +
      explicit `dc cvac`).
    - Write the BD: `addr_lo`, `addr_hi`, then
      `status = (len << 16) | SOP | EOP | TX_CRC`.
    - **Do NOT set `DMA_OWN` (bit 15) on TX BDs.** That bit is a
      RX-only convention on GENET. Setting it on TX BDs causes the
      controller to consume the descriptor through `cons_index` but
      **never emit the frame on the wire**. This is one of two GENET
      gotchas that the public references do not flag clearly.
    - Bump `TDMA_RING_PROD_INDEX` (16-bit running counter).
    - Wait for `TDMA_RING_CONS_INDEX == PROD_INDEX` (polled) or for
      the TX-default IRQ (Tier 4).
12. **RX ring init**: mirror TX but on the RDMA block at offset
    `0x2000`. Program each of the 256 BDs with its own DRAM buffer
    address. Initialize SW's `c_index` from HW's `PROD_INDEX` so you
    don't see stale frames.
13. **RBUF passthrough**:
    `RBUF_CTRL |= RBUF_ALIGN_2B` (so L3 hdr lands 4-byte aligned),
    `RBUF_TBUF_SIZE_CTRL = 1`. Without this the RDMA producer index
    never advances.
14. **Enable TX + RX**: `UMAC_CMD |= TX_EN | RX_EN`, set the speed
    bits, optionally `PROMISC` while bringing up.

### Open question: Tier-3 RX (Phoenix, 2026-05-24)

This is honest about a still-unresolved issue at the time of writing.
On the Phoenix port, with everything above in place — `SYS_PORT_CTRL =
EXT_GPHY`, `UMAC_CMD = TX_EN|RX_EN|SPEED_100|PROMISC`,
`RBUF_ALIGN_2B`, all 256 RX BDs programmed with valid 32-bit-aligned
phys addresses — **RX still doesn't deliver**: `RDMA_PROD_INDEX` stays
at 0 even when host `tcpdump` confirms the bridge is sending unicast
replies to our successful TX. Things still untried (see Phoenix's
`memory/project_genet_tier3_open.md` for the live note):

- Linux's **full DMA-disable handshake** before init: read `DMA_CTRL`,
  clear `DMA_EN`, poll `DMA_STATUS` until the `DISABLED` bit asserts,
  then re-enable. The Pi 4 firmware logs a `GENET STOP: 0` message
  before kernel handoff; that may leave the block in a state that
  rejects fresh RX init unless the full disable sequence runs.
- `GR_BRIDGE_CTRL` (`GENET_GR_BRIDGE_OFF = 0x0040`) — Linux touches
  it during init; we have not yet.
- 35-bit DMA translation: while `va2pa()` returning a sub-4 GB phys
  works fine for TX (verified on the wire), it is not certain that
  RX writes follow the same translation. Some bus paths on BCM2711
  require an explicit `addr_hi` even when the high 3 bits are 0.

If you hit the same wall, start by comparing your init order
**register-write by register-write** against U-Boot's
`bcmgenet_setup_rx_ring`. The shortest non-Linux RX reference is
U-Boot's ~600 LOC polling-only driver.

### Reference drivers

- Linux `drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/genet/` (the canonical reference;
  ~6 kLOC across `bcmgenet.c`, `bcmmii.c`, `bcmgenet_wol.c`).
- U-Boot `drivers/net/bcmgenet.c` (~600 LOC, polled-only, smallest
  proven path to "TFTP works").
- Circle `lib/bcm54213.cpp` (~1.9 kLOC, MIT-ish, fully bare-metal,
  IRQ-driven TX with polled RX).
- FreeBSD `sys/arm64/broadcom/genet/if_genet.c` (BSD-2, fully working).
- NetBSD `sys/dev/ic/bcmgenet.c` (the original BSD port).


## UART & console

### PL011 vs mini-UART

BCM2711 ships with multiple UARTs. The two that matter for bring-up:

- **PL011** at ARM-side phys `0xFE201000` — the canonical ARM PrimeCell
  UART, full feature set, FIFOs, interrupts.
- **mini-UART** at `0xFE215040` — a simpler, slower (8-bit FIFO) UART
  whose baud is tied to the core clock; useful when PL011 is needed
  elsewhere.

By default `start4.elf` routes the PL011 to Bluetooth (BCM43455) and the
mini-UART to GPIO14/15 (the header pins). For debug-console work this
is exactly backwards — you want PL011 on the header pins.

Add to `config.txt`:

```
dtoverlay=miniuart-bt        # swap: mini-UART → BT, PL011 → header
enable_uart=1
uart_2ndstage=1              # firmware also logs to UART
init_uart_baud=115200
init_uart_clock=48000000
```

The `init_uart_clock=48000000` line pins the PL011 reference clock to
48 MHz. Combined with `force_turbo=1` + `core_freq=250` it gives a stable
PL011 divisor independent of CPU clock scaling.

### Two paths to the wire

A subtle thing if you have both a UART debug console and an HDMI
framebuffer console:

- **Path A** (direct MMIO from kernel): busy-wait on PL011 `FR.TXFF`,
  write to PL011 `DR`. Synchronous, byte-by-byte. Used by early-boot
  `printf`/`debug()` paths. Does **not** mirror to any other sink.
- **Path B** (userspace TTY mirror): kernel writes go to a TTY device
  via the syscall layer; the TTY driver writes to PL011 **and** to the
  HDMI framebuffer (per-pixel drawChar).

A typical bring-up bug pattern: hundreds of lines visible on UART, only
a handful visible on HDMI. The cause is that early kernel messages take
Path A and never reach the TTY mirror. Knowing which path each message
takes is essential when diagnosing "boot looks stuck" issues — periodic
HDMI screenshots from a capture card complement the UART log because
they capture some Path-B-only state changes that arrive late or in a
different order.

### Cost of byte-by-byte busy-wait

Each character takes one UART-frame-time on the wire (≈87 µs at 115200
baud) plus the FIFO fill/drain pacing. For a kernel with ~100 KB of
debug output during boot, that is **several seconds of pure UART stall
time** on top of the actual work. If your boot looks too slow, count
your debug strings before profiling the kernel.


## Debugging strategy

The most useful tools for Pi 4 bring-up, in order of how often they
save the day:

1. **A captive netboot bridge with `tcpdump`.** Host the TFTP server
   yourself, run `tcpdump` on the bridge interface, and you can see
   every frame the Pi sends or rejects. Several Pi 4 networking bugs
   are only diagnosable from the host side (the Phoenix Tier 3 RX bug
   was first confirmed by `tcpdump` showing the bridge's unicast ARP
   reply while the Pi's RDMA ring stayed empty).
2. **QEMU's gdbstub for early-boot state.** `qemu-system-aarch64
   -machine raspi4b -kernel kernel8.img -s -S` lets you single-step
   the kernel entry, inspect registers, and watch the MMU/cache enable
   step in a controlled environment. The platform model is imperfect —
   PCIe / VL805 / GENET / HDMI behave differently from silicon — but
   for "what does my SCTLR write actually do" the gdbstub is fast and
   reliable.
3. **UART markers per stage.** A single-character `putc` at the entry
   of each boot stage costs nothing and tells you which stage the
   system reached. If you have hangs that look like "no output at all",
   it usually means you crashed before reaching `putc`; if you have
   hangs after a specific marker, you have a 1-stage-wide search space.
4. **HDMI screenshots from a USB capture card.** The framebuffer
   sometimes carries text the UART path doesn't (or carries the same
   text in a different order, which itself is informative).
5. **Cross-referencing what Linux, FreeBSD, Circle, U-Boot, and ATF
   do** for the same hardware. This is the move that broke the
   Phoenix `PC=0x400498` mystery (see war stories below). Anything
   every other working stack does and your code doesn't is a real
   candidate root cause.

A diagnostic anti-pattern: iterating on the same bit of code (cache
enable, DMA bring-up, PCIe register write) for days without sanity-
checking the **EL3-only setup** beneath it. EL3 setup written into the
armstub doesn't change when you `make` the kernel, so kernel-side
edits cannot fix EL3 bugs. The same kernel code can be correct on one
ARMv8-A platform and crash on another because of EL3-only setup that
the kernel doesn't see.


## Pitfalls and war stories

This section is short on purpose. Each item is a real bug that cost
someone real time during a Pi 4 port.

### The `S3_1_C15_C2_2` silent corruption

A common header for "A72 r0p3 errata sysreg" names
`CPUACTLR2_EL1 = S3_1_C15_C2_2`. That encoding is **not a documented
A72 sysreg**. Writes to it are not guaranteed to have any effect; they
may also silently corrupt whatever physical reg happens to live at that
encoding on a given silicon revision. The correct workaround target
for erratum 1319367 on Cortex-A72 r0p3 is `CPUACTLR_EL1[46]` (encoding
`S3_1_C15_C2_0`, same register as erratum 859971, different bit). Trust
ARM Trusted Firmware's `cortex_a72.S errata_a72_1319367_wa` over any
third-party header.

**Phoenix war story.** For weeks the Phoenix kernel crashed at
`PC=0x400498`, `ESR=0x02000000`, `FAR=0x0` immediately after enabling
`SCTLR_EL1.M|C|I`. The fault site was the first cacheable D-side load
following the SCTLR write — a literal-pool fetch with PC-relative
addressing. Every variant of the kernel cache-enable sequence — M-only,
M|C, staged, deferred, with various dsb/isb/ic-iallu permutations —
crashed at the exact same PC. The root cause turned out to be two EL3
bugs:

1. The armstub used `S3_1_C15_C2_2` for erratum 1319367. The
   mitigation never actually applied.
2. The armstub never programmed `L2CTLR_EL1 = 0x22`. The A72 cluster
   L2's data RAM timing was at the TRM default, which BCM2711's
   1.5 GHz silicon does not meet. The first cacheable load after
   `SCTLR.C=1` returned corrupt data.

The fix was a two-line change to the armstub. The kernel code, which
had been edited and re-tested dozens of times, was unchanged.

The lesson: **before iterating on kernel SCTLR/cache code, cross-check
your EL3 setup against the canonical Pi armstub, against ARM Trusted
Firmware's `plat_reset_handler`, and against the Cortex-A72 TRM's
"Initialisation requirements" section.** Different SoCs need different
EL3 setup. Same kernel code can be correct on one platform and crash
on another because of EL3-only setup that doesn't survive any kernel
change.

### PCIe `0xDEADDEAD` after a perfectly correct mmap

VL805 BAR0 is 4 KiB. If you map 64 KiB across it (a common copy-paste
from x86 xHCI bring-up where MMIO regions are 16 KiB+), speculative or
compiler-coalesced reads spill past the BAR, the brcmstb RC aborts the
access, and you see `0xDEADDEAD`. See the PCIe section for the full
multi-cause analysis; the headline is **probe the BAR size, map
exactly that**.

### GENET TX without `SYS_PORT_CTRL = EXT_GPHY`

`SYS_PORT_CTRL` defaults to `0` (`PORT_MODE_INT_EPHY`). On Pi 4 the
internal EPHY is not the active interface — the MAC needs to drive the
**external** BCM54213PE over RGMII. Without changing this register the
TDMA engine **silently consumes descriptors via CONS_INDEX** but
nothing reaches the wire. From the driver's perspective TX looks fine.
From a host `tcpdump`'s perspective the Pi is invisible.

### GENET TX BDs with `DMA_OWN` set

The `DMA_OWN` (bit 15) of the descriptor status word is an **RX-only**
convention on GENET. On RX the host clears it after consuming a frame
and the controller sets it when it deposits one. On TX the producer-
index write is the SW-to-HW handoff, and `DMA_OWN` must remain clear.
Setting it on a TX BD reproduces the silent-failure mode of the
previous bug.

### The Pi 4 firmware does not push the MAC into UMAC

Most BCM2835/BCM2837-era references (Pi 3, Pi Zero) say the VPU
firmware pre-programs `UMAC_MAC0`/`UMAC_MAC1` with the OTP MAC.
**This is not true on Pi 4** in shipping configurations. The firmware
patches the device tree `local-mac-address` property and expects the OS
to read it back into UMAC. If your driver reads `UMAC_MAC0/MAC1` and
trusts the result, you'll see `00:00:00:00:00:00` and lwIP will treat
your interface as deeply confused.

Workable strategies, in order of robustness:

1. Parse the DT and read `local-mac-address`. Requires a DTB parser
   in the right process.
2. Issue a mailbox property request with tag `0x00010003`. Requires the
   mailbox interface up.
3. Fall back to a locally-administered MAC for bring-up only; flag in
   logs.

### The 4 GB DTB has two `/memory@*` nodes

Reiterated here because it has bitten enough porters. A DT parser
walking only the first `/memory*` node will see ~948 MB and lose the
upper 3 GB. Make sure your parser handles multiple memory nodes from
day one; retrofitting is more painful than starting that way.

### The VPU keeps running

Treating the GPU reserve as cacheable system memory is wrong. The VPU
writes to it (HDMI scanout, mailbox responses if you put the buffer
there). A cacheable alias on the ARM side will read stale data and may
write dirty lines back over the VPU's writes on eviction. Map the GPU
reserve as Device memory (or Normal-NC) and accept the throughput cost;
the alternative is invisible corruption.

### Single-shot `M|C|I` MMU enable can hang on A72 r0p3 + BCM2711

Even with all errata workarounds applied, some Pi 4 stacks find that
the bootloader/early kernel cannot reliably enable `M`, `C`, and `I`
of `SCTLR_EL1` in a single instruction. The workaround is staged enable
(`M` first; `C|I` later from a known-good cacheable PC). This is
historically Phoenix-plo's pattern; we have no published root-cause
analysis, but the workaround is reproducible.

### PCIe state after `NOTIFY_XHCI_RESET` is not deterministic

After the mailbox call that re-loads VL805's SRAM, the inbound DMA
bridge state can be left in a configuration where the first xHCI
`R/S = 1` triggers `USBSTS.HSE`. The defensive pattern is to re-disable
`RC_BAR1` and re-program `RC_BAR2` after the mailbox call, and to
revalidate every register you depend on before issuing the first DMA.
Even with those workarounds, some boots see HSE intermittently;
oscilloscope / JTAG tracing is the next step beyond code-only fixes.


## Phoenix-RTOS case study

This is the section where the document narrows from "any Pi 4 OS" to
"what specifically the Phoenix-RTOS port looks like at the time of
writing". Use it as **worked examples**, not as a recipe.

### Boot pipeline (Phoenix-specific)

```
start4.elf  →  phoenix-armstub8-rpi4.bin (replaces armstub8.bin)
            →  kernel8.img (a plo + reloc stub)
            →  initramfs loader.disk (kernel ELF, dummyfs, devfs, ...)

armstub (EL3):
  - LOCAL_CONTROL prescaler
  - CNTFRQ_EL0, CNTHCTL_EL2, CNTVOFF_EL2
  - SCR_EL3 (NS | RW | HCE | RES1)
  - CPUACTLR_EL1 |= bit 32 (859971) | bit 46 (1319367)
  - CPUECTLR_EL1 prefetch config + SMPEN
  - L2CTLR_EL1 |= 0x22 (BCM2711 1.5 GHz silicon timing)
  - GICv2 dist + CPU IF init
  - SCTLR_EL2 = 0x30c50830 (RES1 baseline, caches off)
  - eret → EL2 → drop to EL1 → branch into kernel8.img

plo (EL1, caches off):
  - PL011 init, HDMI mailbox + framebuffer
  - Identity-map ARM-visible DRAM (Normal-WB except GPU reserve as Device)
  - SCTLR.M = 1 only; caches stay off here (single-shot M|C|I hangs)
  - Parse user.plo.yaml; load programs to RAM; build syspage; jump to kernel

kernel (EL1):

### Phoenix `config.txt` knobs

```
arm_64bit=1
armstub=phoenix-armstub8-rpi4.bin
kernel=kernel8.img
initramfs loader.disk 0x08000000
enable_uart=1
uart_2ndstage=1
init_uart_baud=115200
init_uart_clock=48000000
dtoverlay=miniuart-bt
force_turbo=1
core_freq=250
gpu_mem=76
hdmi_force_hotplug=1
disable_overscan=1
disable_splash=1
```

Tunable knobs worth knowing:

- `total_mem=` **caps** memory; cannot enlarge it. The high bank
  exposure on 4 GB+ Pi happens via DT nodes added by firmware, not via
  this config knob.
- `start_file=start4cd.elf` + `fixup_file=fixup4cd.dat` switches to the
  compact firmware (~850 KB vs ~2.3 MB); useful when you suspect VC6
  interference.
- `dtparam=audio=off` disables HDMI audio DMA paths.

### Memory layout actually in use on Phoenix 4 GB Pi 4

0x00000100 - 0x000fffff   free for early use
0x00080000 - 0x000fffff   kernel8.img landed here (default kernel_address)

0xfc000000 - 0xfeffffff   peripherals
0xff800000 - 0xff8fffff   ARM-local controllers (GIC, etc.)
```

### Reading a Phoenix boot trace

The Phoenix UART output is dense with single-character per-stage
markers. The marker values here are **Phoenix-specific examples**; if
you adapt the decoder to your own port, change the table to match the
markers you emit.

### Worked example: the `PC=0x400498` crash

See the war story in the previous section. The TL;DR is that two EL3
bugs combined to make every cacheable D-side load after `SCTLR.C=1`
return corrupt data. The fix was in the armstub, not the kernel.

### Worked example: the USB merge

Phoenix originally had two userspace processes for the BCM2711 USB
stack: a `pcie` daemon (bridge bring-up) and the `xhci` driver. Each
opened its own `mmap` of the PCIe outbound window. The second `mmap`
returned `0xDEADDEAD`-pattern reads — BCM2711's PCIe bridge translation
state is per-process / per-mmap. The fix was to fold bridge bring-up
into the xHCI library so a single process owns the bus and the
controller. This is the convention Phoenix already follows on every
other supported board (imx6ull, imxrt106x/117x, ia32); Pi 4 was the
outlier that forced re-discovery.

### Worked example: GENET Tier 1 → Tier 3

Three working steps with corresponding Phoenix manifests:

- **Tier 1 — link-up.** Map MMIO, read `SYS_REV_CTRL`, reset UMAC,
  MDIO bus + BCM54213PE attach, autoneg, link-up. Manifest:
  `manifests/2026-05-24-eth-tier1-link-up.md`.
- **Tier 2 — TX one packet.** TDMA ring 16, single-slot polled TX,
  `result=0` on a synthetic gratuitous-ARP. Two key fixes that the
  initial implementation got wrong: `SYS_PORT_CTRL = EXT_GPHY` and
  dropping `DMA_OWN` from the TX BD status. Manifest:
  `manifests/2026-05-24-eth-tier2-tx-ok.md`.
- **Tier 3 — TX on wire, RX still open.** Host `tcpdump` confirms the
  TX frame reaches the bridge; the bridge's unicast ARP reply is
  visible on the host side but the Pi's `RDMA_PROD_INDEX` stays at 0.
  Open at end-of-session. Manifest:
  `manifests/2026-05-24-eth-tier3-tx-wire-ok.md`; live notes in
  Phoenix's `memory/project_genet_tier3_open.md`.

### Phoenix tooling worth reusing

Anyone forking the Phoenix infrastructure for their own Pi 4 port may
find these helpful:

- `scripts/snapshot-integration-state.sh` /
  `scripts/restore-integration-state.sh` — capture a manifest of all
  upstream SHAs at a known-good state; restore deterministically.
- `scripts/rebuild-rpi4b-fast.sh` — incremental rebuild + SD image
  refresh.
- `scripts/test-cycle-netboot.sh` — power-cycle the Pi over a smart
  outlet, serve TFTP, capture UART, recover the netboot bridge on
  DHCP timeout.
- `scripts/uart-summary.sh` / `scripts/uart-list.sh` — UART log
  analysis helpers.
- `scripts/qemu-debug.sh --gdb` — QEMU rpi4b model with gdbstub for
  early-boot state capture.


## Pointers for newcomers

A short, opinionated checklist if you are starting fresh:

1. **Read the canonical Pi armstub.** `raspberrypi/tools
   armstubs/armstub8.S` is the reference for EL3 setup. Read it before
   you write your own.
2. **Cross-check your EL3 setup against ARM Trusted Firmware.**
   `plat/rpi/common/aarch64/plat_helpers.S` codifies the errata and
   L2-timing writes. If your armstub diverges, document why.
3. **Iterate against UART + `tcpdump` + HDMI screenshots, in that
   order of usefulness.**
4. **Use QEMU's gdbstub for any early-boot state question you can
   simulate.** Faster than a serial-console boot cycle by an order of
   magnitude.
5. **Always read the DTB at runtime.** Hardcoded addresses will bite
   you on the day Raspberry Pi ships a board revision that moves a
   peripheral.
6. **Treat the GPU reserve as Device memory.** The VPU keeps running.
7. **Plan for a single-process bus owner for PCIe + xHCI on
   microkernels.** Multi-process splits hit a BCM2711-specific
   per-mmap bridge state race.
8. **Walk every `/memory@*` node**, not just the first. The 4 GB SKU
   has two.
9. **When stuck, do what every other working stack does for this SoC.**
   Linux, FreeBSD, Circle, U-Boot, ARM Trusted Firmware, EDK2 each
   represent a partial-overlap view of the BCM2711's quirks; the union
   is the truth.
